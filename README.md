# On The Shoulders of Giants

A ["Get Your Hands Dirty" project](https://ik-shoulders.sarincasm.com/) to learn Flutter

## The Concept

We will explore a potential product feature and use this to learn Flutter, by implementing our ideas as we go along.

Can we offer fans more variety of content and more ways to engage with Onefootball, while gathering an insanely powerful signal for personalizing their experience.

At the same time, can we inspire creators so that they're invested in the success of Onefootball, and have a reason to send their fans to Onefootball, therefore increasing our reach and engagement every time they post content on our platform.

We will build a Creators Page, a profile page with all content that a single creator has posted on Onefootball. We will also explore how we can enable powerful personalization using this central idea.
